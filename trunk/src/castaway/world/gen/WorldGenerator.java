/**
 * Generates a random world. There are constraints on the min/max amount of
 * certain objects to ensure that game difficulty doesn't vary too
 * significantly.
 * 
 * Randomisation affects:
 *   - Island shape
 *   - Placement of flora and fauna
 *   - Placement of 'scripted' areas which always exist on an island
 *   - Graphics associated with berries/fruits etc so they are initially
 *     unidentifiable.
